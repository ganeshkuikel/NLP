Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8), goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (130) and international appearances (212). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 890 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\n","\n","Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"7X9sV3AmTf-d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725342199314,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":751,"user":{"displayName":"Ganesh Kuikel","userId":"14097189478483486866"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","Stop word are used since words like of, them are repeated so many times and stopwords help to remove these words which does not\n","put more value\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"id":"PX9iJa5WTgVk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725340587497,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":620,"user":{"displayName":"Ganesh Kuikel","userId":"14097189478483486866"}},"outputId":"e5e75b87-69fa-42a1-ea4b-e2a96d812766"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'\\nStop word are used since words like of, them, Dr. are repeated so many times and stopwords help to remove these words which does not\\nput more value\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph)\n","stemmer = PorterStemmer()"],"metadata":{"id":"gUYJuYWiUBAJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725342203885,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":588,"user":{"displayName":"Ganesh Kuikel","userId":"14097189478483486866"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Stemming\n","for i,sentence in enumerate(sentences):\n","  words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n","  words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words if word not in set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))]\n","  sentences[i] = \" \".join(words)"],"metadata":{"id":"hPPuHOE4UIhh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725342208667,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":737,"user":{"displayName":"Ganesh Kuikel","userId":"14097189478483486866"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(sentences)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qi-_ntmRU0xh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725342210800,"user_tz":-345,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Ganesh Kuikel","userId":"14097189478483486866"}},"outputId":"c61ec176-f4e7-4810-8e2a-c7df30d77192"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['cristiano ronaldo do santo aveiro goih comm ( portugues pronunci : [ kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu ] ; born 5 februari 1985 ) portugues profession footbal play forward captain saudi pro leagu club al nassr portug nation team .', \"wide regard one greatest player time , ronaldo five ballon d'or award , [ note 3 ] record three uefa men 's player year award , four european golden shoe , european player .\", 'he 33 trophi career , includ seven leagu titl , five uefa champion leagu , uefa european championship uefa nation leagu .', 'ronaldo hold record appear ( 183 ) , goal ( 140 ) assist ( 42 ) champion leagu , appear ( 30 ) , assist ( 8 ) , goal european championship ( 14 ) , intern goal ( 130 ) intern appear ( 212 ) .', 'he one player made 1,200 profession career appear , outfield player , score 890 offici senior career goal club countri , make top goalscor time .', 'ronaldo began senior career sport cp , sign manchest unit 2003 , win fa cup first season .', \"he would also go win three consecut premier leagu titl , champion leagu fifa club world cup ; age 23 , first ballon d'or .\", 'ronaldo subject then-most expens associ footbal transfer sign real madrid 2009 transfer worth €94 million ( £80 million ) .', 'he becam key contributor form attack trio karim benzema gareth bale integr team win four champion leagu 2014 2018 , includ la décima .', \"dure period , back-to-back ballon d'or 2013 2014 , 2016 2017 , runner-up three time behind lionel messi , perceiv career rival .\", \"he also becam club 's all-tim top goalscor all-tim top scorer champion leagu , finish competit 's top scorer six consecut season 2012 2018 .\", 'with real , ronaldo four champion leagu , two la liga titl , two copa del rey , two uefa super cup three club world cup .', 'in 2018 , sign juventu transfer worth initi €100 million ( £88 million ) , expens transfer italian club player 30 year old .', 'he two seri a titl , two supercoppa italiana trophi coppa italia , becam inaugur seri a most valuabl player becam first footbal finish top scorer english , spanish italian leagu .', \"he return manchest unit 2021 , finish full season club 's top scorer , contract termin 2022 .\", 'in 2023 , sign al nassr .']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"tPFzKalnVHUt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
